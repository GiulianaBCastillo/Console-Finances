# Console-Finances
# Usage

I created this project to provide the code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset from January 2010 until February 2017. You can access the data by right-clicking the cursor and selecting 'inspect' on your browser and then opening the 'console' tab on the Developer Tools.
